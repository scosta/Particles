# Particles

An implementation of a simple particle engine.  The core logic lies in the point sprite and particle classes.  With the point sprite class one can draw textured quads in arbitrary positions which always face the viewer.  The particle class allows a wide variety of effects to be created simply by changing the velocity and acceleration values of the particles.
